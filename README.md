# Minerva-Framework
This is a opensource framework for setting up a hidden service marketplace. While there are many illegal markets on the Tor network, there are a few legitimate ones that do operate. For example someone may want to sell religous items that are illegal in another country. Or you may not want to pay for a domain.

However let me be clear, I do not endorse or condone using this framework for the sale of any illegal drugs, weapons, pornography, or any other illegal substances, materials, or items.

I designed this as a way for people to break free of the control big tech has over our lives an businesses.

This being said if you use this framework for illegal operations this is on you. I am in no way responsible for what you do.
I did not hold a gun to your head and force you to use it.
Now with all the legal stuff out of the way, enjoy!
